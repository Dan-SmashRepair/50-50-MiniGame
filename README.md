# 50-50-MiniGame
RLBot Script

Simply be the first to touch the ball outside the middle circle.

Recommended but not required:
- Disable goal reset
- Tickrate = 120
- Map: Mannfield for clear center circle, but any standard map will work

I'm currently training Omus, a RLGym bot specific to this gamemode. The end goal is to have a 50/50 sparing partner for humans and bots of all levels
